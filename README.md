##### UPDATE 2024.3.15

###### Our paper was accepted by the 2024 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN 2024 Oral).


##### UPDATE 2024.8.25 
###### To make using our methodology easier, we uploaded our full dataset *[CCTSDB-AUG](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/haoqinhong/cctsdb-aug-ijcnn-2024)* on the KAGGLE platform (Please cite our paper and dataset).

###### You can also compare our metrics in *[Paper with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/ccspnet-joint-efficient-joint-training-method)*.

##### Project Guidence 
The image denoising module of our model utilizes the 4kDehazing model(cite: https://github.com/zzr-idam/4KDehazing.git), 
while the object detection module incorporates the improved model CCSPNet, 
which is based on the YOLOv5 baseline, as proposed in our article.
This model is a joint training model, and each training session will generate two pth files: 'best.pt' for the object detection model 
and 'best_4k.pt' for the image denoising model.

The proposed method and comparisons in this paper were conducted under a unified data augmentation approach. To replicate the experiments, you will need to download the dataset and pre-trained weights and place them in a specific directory. 
Then, in the terminal, run the command：python train_ccspnet_joint.py --rect

It is worth noting that the joint training model defines a joint loss function calculation formula as 
loss = alpha * loss1 + beta * loss2, 
where alpha and beta are hyperparameters. Through extensive experimentation, it has been found that setting alpha = beta = 0.5 yields good results.
